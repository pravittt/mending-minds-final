                <p>A gambler may become addicted because of the constant rewards or reinforcements that they are given in the gambling situation. The nature of such reinforcements can be multiple. For instance, they could be financial eg, winning money, physiological the thrill and the" buzz" of gambling, psychological eg, raising of self-esteem, peer praise and/or psychosocial eg, the social meaning of the activity, rites of passage etc.</p>
